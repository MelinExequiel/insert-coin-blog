      <h1>Review: Resident Evil</h1>
      <p>Rumors of disappearances and severed bodies were circulating around the Arklay Mountains in the western United States, so a special division of the police force named S.T.A.R.S has the task of investigating if that was true, or just unfounded rumors.
        They were divided into two teams: the Bravo team was the first to go and investigate the area but all contact with them disappeared.
        So 24 hours later, the Alpha team was sent to the place. After they arrived, they were attacked by some savage beasts and found refuge in a mansion in the middle of the forest, starting one of the most enigmatic video games in history...Resident Evil.</p>
      <h1 style="text-align: center;"><img src="img/re/residentevil.jpg" alt="resident evil title" width="400" height="300"></h1>
      <p>Originally conceived as a remake of the video game Sweet Home, the development of Resident Evil (also known in Japan as Biohazard) was directed by Shinji Mikami who, realizing the potential of new Sony Playstation, decided to abandon the remake idea and opted to design a new video game from scratch, but keeping a few things from the original approach, such as using key objects, solving puzzles and one of the main scenarios: The Mansion</p>
      <p>It was planned that the new video game would be in first person, since DOOM was the rage at that time, but Mikami wasn't entirely convinced since the game would be focused more on the action than the horror itself.
        After studying a very novel game called Alone in the Dark, the decision was made to send the first person's idea to the trash and make the video game using polygonal figures on pre rendered backgrounds, resulting in the video game we know today. 
        After three years of development, Biohazard was released on March 22, 1996 and eight days later it was released in America and Europe under the name of Resident Evil, since the name Biohazard was registered by a musical band.</p>
      <p>Resident Evil is inspired by Class B horror movies, but with a very novel difference: the zombies and creatures that inhabit the mansion are not made by magic, but by a virus propagated by one of the leaders of Umbrella Corporation, a company that creates biological weapons under the guise of a respected pharmaceutical industry, infecting all the mansion staff, as well the fauna that inhabits around the mountains.</p>
      <h1 style="text-align: center;"><img src="img/re/re_zombie.jpg" alt="resident evil title" width="400" height="300"></h1>
      <p>We can choose to play with one of the two playable members of the Alpha team: Cris Redfield or Jill Valentine. 
        Each one has their own qualities, for example Cris has greater resistance, while Jill has more space to store items. 
        After choosing between one of them, we control the character using the up directional pad to move it forward, down to go back and the side controls to rotate it to the desired direction.</p>
        <h1 style="text-align: center;"><img src="img/re/re_characters.jpg" alt="resident evil title" width="400" height="300"></h1>
      <p>Several important objects are necessary to be able to continue advancing in the game.
        Depending on the combat system, we can use weapons and ammunition to defend ourselves against the creatures.
        As the character is injured, there isn't animation showing the health status and with no visible HUD, we must constantly check the item inventory to check their weapons, ammunition and health items.
        The character's health is determined by an electrocardiogram which changes color depending on the severity of the injuries: green for Good, yellow and orange for Caution, and red for Danger which means that the next attack can kill our character and end the game.</p>
      <h1 style="text-align: center;"><img src="img/re/re_hud.png" alt="resident evil title" width="400" height="300"></h1>
      <p>In order to have available spaces in the inventory, it's necessary to go to a specific point where we must save all the objects obtained in the game to continue advancing, which can be used again in the future.
        However, the weapons ammo is scarce, so we must use the ammunition with some prudence to have a chance of survival.
        To save the game, we have an item called Ink Ribbon which can be used in a typewriter that is scattered at different points.
        The end of the game varies depending on the decisions we made during the course of it.</p>
      <p>Resident Evil / Biohazard became one of the most acclaimed in video games history, so much that it was ported to numerous consoles, received several special editions and got an impressive remake made for Nintendo GameCube in 2002.</p>
