      <h1>Review: Mortal Kombat</h1>
      <p>While Street Fighter II dominated the world of video games, a couple of Developers, Ed Boon and John Tobias got to work to produce a title to enter where the successful Capcom title was reigning and the solution was to resort to violence.
        With a full range of charismatic characters together with a blood bath, they ended up spawning one of the most controversial video games of its era.</p>
      <h1 style="text-align: center;"><img src="img/mk/mortalkombat.png" alt="mortal kombat title" width="400" height="300"></h1>
      <p>The plot explains that a sorcerer named Shang Tsung every so often organizes a Mortal Kombat tournament between two realms: Outworld and Earthrealm, where if the earth loses, Shang Tsung will bring their host to invade it.
        Ten of them must be won, and Outworld has already won nine, thanks to the alliance with a prince named Goro, whose brute force has facilitated the near fulfillment of Shang Tsung's dark intentions, so this is the last chance to stop it.</p>
      <p>The list of fighters is very varied despite being summarized only to seven playable characters: Liu Kang, Sonya Blade, Johnny Cage, Raiden, Kano, Scorpion, Sub Zero; two non playable characters: Shang Tsung and Goro; and Reptile, a secret character. 
        Each of these fighters despite having the same basic attacks, they have their own special attacks and two fatalities, each in addition to their own story that complements the original story title.</p>
      <h1 style="text-align: center;"><img src="img/mk/mk_characters.jpg" alt="mortal kombat characters" width="400" height="300"></h1>
      <p>At first, Mortal Kombat has the typical gameplay of any fighting video game but the charm are the Fatalities, that are characteristic final moves of each character to finish off their adversary to show their flawless victory. 
        In single player mode, we have to face the other six remaining fighters in order according to the character selected. Later we have to face ourselves and then against Goro, to finally face the evil Shang Tsung. It should be noted that from time to time, they have to test your might through different mini games.</p>
      <p>Graphically, Mortal Kombat at that time boasted of being technically in this section because the characters are represented through digital images taken of real actors representing each of the fighters while the scenarios are made to the smallest detail with a fairly high level of animation that gives a lot of realism to the outline without forgetting the animations of the blood and the severed limbs that are the hallmark of this title.</p>
      <h1 style="text-align: center;"><img src="img/mk/mk_gameplay.jpg" alt="mortal kombat gameplay" width="400" height="300"></h1>
      <p>In the sound section, the special effects and the voices of the expressions of the fighters have a very high level although only Sonya and Liu Kang have their own sound spectrum, while the soundtrack is quite generic, but they fulfill perfectly.</p>
      <p>Due to how controversial the title is, the versions for Nintendo, Super Nintendo and Super Famicom consoles are censored eliminating all the blood and the consequent bloody scenes, but at graphic and sound level they are faithful to the arcade version, while the portable versions of Nintendo Game Boy and Sega Game Gear are very cropped and censored in addition to having a very limited range of movements due to the fact that these consoles have only two actions buttons and bit of input lag.</p>
      <h1 style="text-align: center;"><img src="img/mk/mk_logo.jpg" alt="mortal kombat logo" width="400" height="300"></h1>
      <p>Mortal Kombat is an outstanding title, since it's one of those videos games that revolutionized the industry at a technical level and due to the large amount of controversy it generated in certain conservative sectors of the society that led to the creation of the ESRB to classify video games according to their content.</p>
